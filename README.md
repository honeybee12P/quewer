This repository contains the code to the anonymous question and answer product (quewer) built at startup, Stride (http://stride.ai/)

This product was not launched due to other plans at the company. 

But, had great fun developing it. It was entirely built using Django Python. Go ahead and have a look at how we were able to build it with no experience back then.

If you have any doubts in any parts, you can contact me at kruthika.vishwa@gmail.com
