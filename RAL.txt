What are some things Bollywood films have led us to believe, that are actually not true?Being a doctor, I would like to add a few:

1. That you have to stand in line in government hospital to register yourself even though you are an emergency patient. Please Bollywood, there is a separate department called 'casualty', where all emergency patients are treated first and paper is made after stabilizing the patient.

2. That in accident or cases, doctor does not touch the patient till the police comes. For God's sake, stop spreading these misconceptions which are actually hindering our society from helping people in such cases.

3. That doctor comes out of operation theatre to ask husband 'Hum maa ya bachha dono me se kisi ek ko hi bacha sakte hain' (We can save either mother or child). This is horrendous. In any such case, priority is to always save mother first.

4. That by checking the pulse you can detect pregnancy. 

5. That snakes can back the poison out of you.

6. That in amnesia first questions are like 'Main kahan hoon,
main kaun hoon?' (Where am I? Who am I?). Amnesia is a big universe with different types. Probably way too much for Bollywood people to understand.

7. To the director of Amar Akbar Anthony, please read about blood groups, cross matching and compatibility!

8. Munnabhai MBBS - admission to medical college is not that easy and in no medical college, professor of anatomy performs surgeries.
